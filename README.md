# SMC (Super Mega Cool) Server v0.3.0 by Mahestro_320

The SMC server (SMCS) is a server that receives TCP requests from an SMC Client to access files,
display directory contents, etc.

## How to compile

The client is programmed in **C++ (ISO C++20 Standard)**. To compile it, you can use
**Visual Studio** or the **basic C++ compiler**

> [!WARNING]
> It needs **Boost 1.88.0+ to work**. To do this, **put the Boost include folder in `external`
directory at root**

## How to use

### STRG (storage) directory

The STRG directory contains all server storage and is defined in the STRG constant of the C++
header file `include/directories.hpp`. At the root of STRG, there are two folders: `network` and
`users` (their use is explained below)

### network directory

This folder contains all the users' personal folders with the following name format:
`perso.<username>` and the shared folder `shared`

### users directory

This folder contains all the user folders, and each folder contains a file named `.uif`
(UIF = User Informations) which has some information about the users (more details about the UIF
file below)

### UIF file

A UIF (User Informations) file contains a 16-byte header consisting of a 4-byte signature:
`55 49 46 00` (`UIF\x0`), then a single byte for the user's role (more information on roles below),
and finally 11 bytes with a value of `0x00` to fill in the empty space. After the header comes 32
bytes for the user's name and password (16 bytes for the username and 16 for the password)

## User roles

There are three roles for users: User (basic user), Admin and Developer

### Basic user permissions

It can access its own directory and the shared directory in the network folder

### Admin permissions

It can access everything in the STRG folder

### Developer permissions

It can access all files on every drive connected to the server

## Welcome message

When a client connects, the server sends a welcome message: "SMC"

## Requests

Requests can be sent from the SMC client
IDs are defined in the C++ header file "include/network/request/id.hpp"

## Configuration file

Its location is `data\config.ini` and it contains this values below

> [!NOTE]
> each value is for the example

```ini
[server]

; The port on which the server accepts connections
port=5000

; If the paths given in this category do not have a drive
; letter, then they will be relative to the root
[dirs]

; Server storage
storage=srvdir

; Server logs
logs=logs

[time]

; must respects the C++20 format syntax
format={:%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S}
```

> [!NOTE]
> string values can contains env vars or sysvars

## Abbreviated names

- PUD: Protected User Data
- UPC: User Personnal Content
- SRV: Server
- CLT: Client
 
## Env vars

strings can contains env vars by doing this: `<[VAR NAME]>`. for example: `hello, <USERNAME>` ->
`<USERNAME>` will be replaced by the computer's username

## Sysvars

strings can contains sysvars, like env vars but the syntax is a bit different: `<$[SYSVAR NAME]>`.
for example: `hello, <$username>` -> `<$username>` will be replaced by the username of the client

### Sysvar names

`srv_port`: server port
`srv_address`: server address
`time_format`: time format
`logs_path`: logs path
`storage_path`: storage path

`username`: name of the connected client
`userrole`: role of the connected client

`clt_index`: index of the connected client
`clt_logged`: is the connected client logged (0 or 1)
`clt_port`: port of the connected client
`clt_address`: address of the connected client

`version`: server version

## Properties

properties can be inserted like this: `<:[NAME]=[VALUE]>`. to change text color, do this:
`<:color=[COLOR]>`
